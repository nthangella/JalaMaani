# JalaMaani


In an Indian language, `Jala` means water and `Maani` means a measuring device. This repository has the code to build a simple water level monitor using Raspberry Pi and expose the monitor via web and Amazon Alexa.

I split the project into five parts to simplify the understanding of the code build. I am hoping that this creates interest in youngsters as well elders to get a grasp on using very cost effective devices to build great stuff. I made videos of each part and uploaded them to YouTube. You can find those video links in each part.

## Part - 5

Did you ever have a reliable and loyal assistant? Alexa can help you get the status of water level monitor status. In this part, we will  show how to integrate our monitor with Amazon Alexa.
