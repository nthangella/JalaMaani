# JalaMaani


In an Indian language, `Jala` means water and `Maani` means a measuring device. This repository has the code to build a simple water level monitor using Raspberry Pi and expose the monitor via web and Amazon Alexa.

I split the project into five parts to simplify the understanding of the code build. I am hoping that this creates interest in youngsters as well elders to get a grasp on using very cost effective devices to build great stuff. I made videos of each part and uploaded them to YouTube. You can find those video links in each part.
