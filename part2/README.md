## Part - 2

In this part we will extend the code built in Part-1 to indicate the water level by litting appropriate colored LED (light emitting diode).

Additional materials to complete this part:

- Bread Board
- Four colored LEDs - This project uses blue, green, yellow and red colored LEDs
- Optional t-Cobbler connector. This helps making connections very easy but not a must.
- Two resistors of 300 ohms or more. To reduce current levels in the circuits, I ultimately ended up using 5K resistors.

### Concepts:

#### Bread Board

You can use this to build and test simple circuits without soldering. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard.

#### Light Emitting Device (LED)

This is a semiconductor device that emits light when electricity is applied. https://www.ledsmagazine.com/leds-ssl-design/materials/article/16701292/what-is-an-led. LED is poloarized and should be connected accordingly in the circuit. Longer leg indicates positive and should be on the positive side of the circuit. Improper connection leads to damage to the device or connected equiment and/or injury to body. Connecting the LEDs properly will save possible frustration when circuit doesn't work.

### How to run the code:

- Download the code to your folder '/home/pi/code'.
- Type the command `python3 /home/pi/code/waterLevelDemo2.py`
- To stop the code, press ctrl+c.
