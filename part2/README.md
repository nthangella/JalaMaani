## Part - 2

In this part we will extend the code built in Part-1 to indicate the water level by litting appropriate colored LED (light emitting diode).

Additional materials to complete this part:

- Bread Board
- Four colored LEDs - This project uses blue, green, yellow and red colored LEDs
- Optional t-Cobbler connector. This helps making connections very easy but not a must.
- Two resistors of 300 ohms. To reduce current levels in the circuits, I ultimately ended up using 5K resistors.
